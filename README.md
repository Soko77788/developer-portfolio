# developer-portfolio


## Description

A collection of developed and deployed apps created by me. Projects will be added overtime and some images or spaces may contain place holders. 

This particular app uses only HTML and CSS to create a portfolio home page. Eventually the projects linked will use a collection of languages and technolgies including HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, and many more. 

## Installation

No installation needed as this is a personal porfolio.

## Usage

### Learning

Positioning is pretty difficult early on as a developer. Creating a responsive website for positioning is also difficult. Debugging code is tedious work. We'll use this first build as a jumping off point for the career and build some incredible apps!
